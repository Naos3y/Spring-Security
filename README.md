# Spring Security Authentication and Authorization Project

This project was developed as part of my learning process to understand and implement **Spring Security** with authentication and authorization mechanisms. 
The goal of this project is to explore how to secure a Spring Boot application by implementing user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and role-based authorization.

## Features:
- User registration and authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (USER, ADMIN)
- Secure endpoints with Spring Security

This project serves as a foundation for learning the key concepts of securing applications with Spring Security, including how to configure security filters, manage roles, and protect REST APIs.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or contribute!
